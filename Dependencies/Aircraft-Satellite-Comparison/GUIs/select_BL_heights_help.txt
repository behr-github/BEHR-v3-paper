By default, all profiles will identify the boundary layer height determined by "find_bdy_layer_height" using either the "max" or "theta" methods.

If a profile should not be used in BL heights at all, click the "Reject" button under the correct axes.  (To undo this, click it again - it will then say "Accept");

BL heights can be manually guided by adding ranges that the "find_bdy_layer_height" algorithm should search in.  Add and manipulate these ranges using the buttons to the left of each axes. Multiple ranges can be specified, and the algorithm will return a height for each range.  Once ranges are specified, use the "Reevaluate BL Height" button to recalculate the BL heights.

Quality flags are set to identify manual intervention.  To return to the fully automatic BL height determination, delete all ranges for that field and reevaluate the heights.

Almost all fields find their BL height by searching for the greatest difference between 2 layers.  However any field name that includes "THETA" will use the potential temperature method.  NOTE: when specifying manual ranges for a THETA field, the THETALITE method is used.
